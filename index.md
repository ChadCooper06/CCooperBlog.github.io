# Awesome Inc. Coding Blog

### Week 1

During this first week I have been introduced to the basics of Git, GitHub, GitPods and using the Terminal on my Mac to practice and write code. The challenges have not been numerous or difficult to overcome, yet, but I am positive that I will hit roadblocks over the coming weeks and months.

This first week has been a very good introduction to the difficulties that will lie ahead and I am sure that I will become more and more challenged (which is what I'm hoping will happen as I love solving problems/puzzles). 

Some questions regarding this first week and thoughts on it;

**Was my first week what I expected?**
    This first week was much more fun than I had assumed it would be and I enjoyed learning how to use GitHub/GitPod/GitPages. I still have more learning to do with them but it's been the right amount of difficulty for a first week.

**What am I eager or excited to learn?**
    Right now, I am eager and excited to keep progressing through all of the introductory information and begin to get better and become slightly more capable. In the future, I am excited to learn a couple languages that can help me make beautiful and functional code.    

**What is something that can be learned about me simply by reading this blog?**
    The most obvious thing is that can be divined about me from this blog (as it continues along), is that I enjoy challenges and I am not afraid to ask for help when I need it. 
    I like to learn so I enjoy being *nudged* towards the answer. I also try to be a helpful person whenever the opportunity arrises.

\*As an aside, I may mention my cat a bit too often __LOL__\*

### Week 2

During week 2 I have gotten better at using GitHub and GitPod and working with the CLI on GitPod. We also started using HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). I have worked with these some on my own in the past and this has been both a refresher and an increase in both knowledge and skills. 

The *__COOLEST__* thing I have delved into this week has been the DevTools on Chrome and playing around with those has _literally_ left a smile on my face and I am excited to continue to learn more about them and become more proficient in their use (as well as everything else I am learning \*e.g. CSS\*).

**What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?**
    The obvious answer here is that I wish I had the skills to make a really cool and interactive website or program. I know I'm on my way there, very slowly, and that it will be awhile before I reach that level of competency. However, I also know that I am further along at this point than I thought I would be and I am proud of the degree of skill my fellow students and myself have already achieved.

**What are you struggling with?**
    Currently I am not *struggling* with any specific skill, technic or aspect of the class. I am aware, however, that I __will__ end up struggling a lot during the bootcamp. I am ready for that though... I am not sure if I am trying to convince myself with that statement or if it's true but I won't stop until the struggling is in the past.

**How do you solve a problem?**
    Thus far, when I have encountered any problems, I have ventured to find the answer on my own with the help of my classmates, instructors and a couple friends who code for work as my backups. I have not yet encountered an issue that I have been unable to surmount on my own during bootcamp, but when it does happen I will have a safety net of people who will keep me from falling too far. Plus, the almighty Google has been a slight help too.

**What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?**
    My initial tactic to unclog myself from an issue is to take a short break and walk away for a few minutes. I usually spend 3-5 minutes playing with my cat or playing a short game on my phone just to disconnect my brain from the issue so that when I return to it a couple minutes later I am looking at it with fresh eyes. Then, if that doesn't fix it, I will try to get help from Google.


### Week 3

SHEW! Week three has been **_ROUGH_** but it was also very enlightening. I struggled a lot and still managed to end the week with a working set of code. There were other things I would have loved to have been able to do to the alarm clock I made, but I simply ran out of time with having to research so much due to my skill level being as low as it is. Even with that lack of progression (in my opinion only), I feel that I did a fair job and learned a lot. I failed __often__ this week and managed to break my code over and over and over and over. I have gained a modicum of confidence..but as Vikram said in that episode of _The Office_:

>"Confidence. The food of the wise man, but the liqour of the fool."

With that said, I cannot let my gained confidence make me think I can code like a professional just yet. I have a ways to go.

**What are my thoughts on the roles HTML, CSS and Javascript play in the process of rendering content and providing a user experience?**
    In my opinion, and the scope there is limited due to how little knowledge I have regarding code languages, HTML, CSS and JS are what create the actual page and interfaces that we see and use daily on the internet. I know there are other languages doing work behind the curtain and many many more that can do very cool things on the user side (maybe learn some of them during bootcamp). I like HTML and CSS...JS has been a love/hate relationship thus far. I like what I can do with it, but I dislike how difficult it is to make it do those things. As I gain experience with it I know I will like it more, but honestly, this week of trying to fight with it has been very frustrating and there were times I wanted to make it disappear like a mobster doing "waste disposal". Then, when it worked, I saw that the plain, basic thing I had written with my HTML and CSS could function and do some cool stuff.
    I think a webpage made without all of these would be a very drab affair, if it could even be made at all. The possibilities I see with the combination of HTML, CSS and JS make me excited because I am eager to continue to learn more and try new things. The level of functionality and usability they can give when combined is just a very cool thing to know even exists, let alone being something I can **DO**.

**What are some objects that my blog incorporates?**
    Currently, as I am using a premade layout for my blog (that will change), there aren't many objects that I can see using DevTools. I see a document object, which allows my JS to connect to my HTML, and a navigator object which appears to show something about the browser...though my assumption there could be falso and I don't know what information it's trying to convey *yet*. There also appears to be a metas object but I have no clue what it does. At some point I will make this blog my own and fill it with objects, functions and variables. It will be like the British Museum, except its contents would actually be mine. That's a future me thing, though he needs to get started or I will start ribbing him for being a lazy nerd.
    
    
### Week 4

Week 4 has been equally as confusing as the previous weeks but we did a cool thing and made a bouncing ball app using JS. Nervous for the in person classes and what all else we have to learn but still looking forward to the weeks ahead. Writing code is not an easy thing to do but I will do it! With each new week I feel that we are all getting better and better and I can see that while my growth is slow, it is also not stopping. That makes me very happy. This week saw no specific questions asked of me for inclusion in the blog so that just means that we've been given a small reprieve before in person class starts.


### Week 5

FIRST week of in person classes and it has been a rollercoaster of emotions and code. We learned a lot about atomic design, using Bootstrap and our introduction to "state" and state management began. Thus far, I have almost zero clue about how state works but hopefully soon I will begin to understand it. Our project was a mind reading game that used a mathematical algorithm to "predict" a symbol you "chose".


### Week 8

Halfway through the entire bootcamp and still loving every second. This week we were introduced to React and used that JS library to create a website for a fake restaurant. The React library seems to help make the process of creating a site much more developer friendly as it gives you more concise ways to write JS. I have very much enjoyed this week and the project we completed. We also did a React project where we were tasked with taking an already complete page that was riddled with bugs and finding and fixing them all. This helped me understand how easy some bugs are to make and how they can completely break your code. It also gave me a good chance to learn some other things in React that weren't part of the regular instructions for the first half of the week. 

Some questions relating to this week and my thoughts are:

Do you think JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries are easy or hard to use? Why?
    * I think that JS frameworks and libraries are easier than vanilla JS because they allow the developer to use smaller and more concise components of code to do the same thing as something more verbous. This keeps your code cleaner and pervents as many mistakes as there is less overall characters generally. It is also a more structured way of writing in JS, which is very much not structured, and that leads to less confusion and an easier ability to read the code that is written.
    * The only difficult aspect of React was the learning curve for the ways it differs from vanilla JS and how certain components of it need to be written in certain locations and orders so it can work...as well as the need for parameters and functions to have names specific to them and as descriptive as possible.

What Frameworks or Libraries are you interested in learning more about?
    * I want to learn more of React as I really like the way it is set up and I like the ways that it improves the vanilla JS framework.
    * I have not researched many other libraries but if they are all similar in usage to React and keep JS from being as open to possibilities as vanilla JS is then I imagine I will like them.

Find one emerging JavaScript tool that you would like to learn more about or use in your final project.
    *At this point, learning more React would be really ideal, as well as just learning more JS. However, Vue.js seems to be something I may enjoy as well. From the little I have read on it thus far it seems to use a lot of the same syntax as React but with simpler techniques that become more flexible in some cases.
    
    
### Week 9

Week 9 is the second week of React and we worked on making a to-do list app...which caused us all to hate the words 'to-do' because we used them too many times. This week was hard for me as I had some of my depression and anxiety creep in and that caused me to kind of retreat into myself while doing the project, which I think hampered my work a little. I still had a working app on Friday and I am still proud of what I made because it was not something I could have done last week or even on Monday. I know that one of my weaknesses in the bootcamp is that I don't ask questions as much as I probably should and I am working on that. I have always been a bit of a loner and typically feel like I bother people if I ask them anything...that's a me thing though and it is something that I think this bootcamp is helping to break me out of.
    This week was also very fun for me and I have seen a lot of growth in my skill and my (still low but growing) confidence level. I have a great group of fellow students and the instructors are some of the coolest people. Also, I love React and have begun porting my blog over into a new repo that uses React

What have you learned about CLIs? Do you think they are scary?
    CLIs, command line interfaces, are not scary..but they can take some time to get used to using. I have experience with DOS from when I was young and from two previous jobs so using my terminal isn't scary but the needed terminology in newer CLIs has been sometimes difficult to remember.

If you were to build a CLI, what would it do?
    If I were to build a CLI I suppose it would be similar to others. I know that in my background investigator position the CLI we used would take in MS Word formatted information we typed and convert it to another form that was easier for it to save and display in a searchable fashion(and was the only US Government system to never be hacked) so If I were able to make one I would like it to be something similar where it could be used to help keep sensitive information secret while presenting an easy way to search and add to it.
    
List some ideas that without a Framework, would take you a long time to code.
    I think that the to-do list would have taken a VERY long time for me to code without the React framework and making any kind of server side system would be difficult without the use of Python, which we are starting next week. Any of the more functional websites would be very bloated with code if it weren't for frameworks making the formatting easier.
