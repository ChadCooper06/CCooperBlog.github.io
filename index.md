# Awesome Inc. Coding Blog

### Week 1

During this first week I have been introduced to the basics of Git, GitHub, GitPods and using the Terminal on my Mac to practice and write code. The challenges have not been numerous or difficult to overcome, yet, but I am positive that I will hit roadblocks over the coming weeks and months.

This first week has been a very good introduction to the difficulties that will lie ahead and I am sure that I will become more and more challenged (which is what I'm hoping will happen as I love solving problems/puzzles). 

Some questions regarding this first week and thoughts on it;

**Was my first week what I expected?**
    This first week was much more fun than I had assumed it would be and I enjoyed learning how to use GitHub/GitPod/GitPages. I still have more learning to do with them but it's been the right amount of difficulty for a first week.

**What am I eager or excited to learn?**
    Right now, I am eager and excited to keep progressing through all of the introductory information and begin to get better and become slightly more capable. In the future, I am excited to learn a couple languages that can help me make beautiful and functional code.    

**What is something that can be learned about me simply by reading this blog?**
    The most obvious thing is that can be divined about me from this blog (as it continues along), is that I enjoy challenges and I am not afraid to ask for help when I need it. 
    I like to learn so I enjoy being *nudged* towards the answer. I also try to be a helpful person whenever the opportunity arrises.

\*As an aside, I may mention my cat a bit too often __LOL__\*

### Week 2

During week 2 I have gotten better at using GitHub and GitPod and working with the CLI on GitPod. We also started using HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). I have worked with these some on my own in the past and this has been both a refresher and an increase in both knowledge and skills. 

The *__COOLEST__* thing I have delved into this week has been the DevTools on Chrome and playing around with those has _literally_ left a smile on my face and I am excited to continue to learn more about them and become more proficient in their use (as well as everything else I am learning \*e.g. CSS\*).

**What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?**
    The obvious answer here is that I wish I had the skills to make a really cool and interactive website or program. I know I'm on my way there, very slowly, and that it will be awhile before I reach that level of competency. However, I also know that I am further along at this point than I thought I would be and I am proud of the degree of skill my fellow students and myself have already achieved.

**What are you struggling with?**
    Currently I am not *struggling* with any specific skill, technic or aspect of the class. I am aware, however, that I __will__ end up struggling a lot during the bootcamp. I am ready for that though... I am not sure if I am trying to convince myself with that statement or if it's true but I won't stop until the struggling is in the past.

**How do you solve a problem?**
    Thus far, when I have encountered any problems, I have ventured to find the answer on my own with the help of my classmates, instructors and a couple friends who code for work as my backups. I have not yet encountered an issue that I have been unable to surmount on my own during bootcamp, but when it does happen I will have a safety net of people who will keep me from falling too far. Plus, the almighty Google has been a slight help too.

**What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?**
    My initial tactic to unclog myself from an issue is to take a short break and walk away for a few minutes. I usually spend 3-5 minutes playing with my cat or playing a short game on my phone just to disconnect my brain from the issue so that when I return to it a couple minutes later I am looking at it with fresh eyes. Then, if that doesn't fix it, I will try to get help from Google.


### Week 3

SHEW! Week three has been **_ROUGH_** but it was also very enlightening. I struggled a lot and still managed to end the week with a working set of code. There were other things I would have loved to have been able to do to the alarm clock I made, but I simply ran out of time with having to research so much due to my skill level being as low as it is. Even with that lack of progression (in my opinion only), I feel that I did a fair job and learned a lot. I failed __often__ this week and managed to break my code over and over and over and over. I have gained a modicum of confidence..but as Vikram said in that episode of _The Office_:

>"Confidence. 
>The food of the wise man, but the liqour of the fool."

With that said, I cannot let my gained confidence make me think I can code like a professional just yet. I have a ways to go.

**What are my thoughts on the roles HTML, CSS and Javascript play in the process of rendering content and providing a user experience?**
    In my opinion, and the scope there is limited due to how little knowledge I have regarding code languages, HTML, CSS and JS are what create the actual page and interfaces that we see and use daily on the internet. I know there are other languages doing work behind the curtain and many many more that can do very cool things on the user side (maybe learn some of them during bootcamp). I like HTML and CSS...JS has been a love/hate relationship thus far. I like what I can do with it, but I dislike how difficult it is to make it do those things. As I gain experience with it I know I will like it more, but honestly, this week of trying to fight with it has been very frustrating and there were times I wanted to make it disappear like a mobster doing "waste disposal". Then, when it worked, I saw that the plain, basic thing I had written with my HTML and CSS could function and do some cool stuff.
    I think a webpage made without all of these would be a very drab affair, if it could even be made at all. The possibilities I see with the combination of HTML, CSS and JS make me excited because I am eager to continue to learn more and try new things. The level of functionality and usability they can give when combined is just a very cool thing to know even exists, let alone being something I can **DO**.

**What are some objects that my blog incorporates?**
    Currently, as I am using a premade layout for my blog (that will change), there aren't many objects that I can see using DevTools. I see a document object, which allows my JS to connect to my HTML, and a navigator object which appears to show something about the browser...though my assumption there could be falso and I don't know what information it's trying to convey *yet*. There also appears to be a metas object but I have no clue what it does. At some point I will make this blog my own and fill it with objects, functions and variables. It will be like the British Museum, except its contents would actually be mine. That's a future me thing, though he needs to get started or I will start ribbing him for being a lazy nerd. :rofl
