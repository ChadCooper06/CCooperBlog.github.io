# Awesome Inc. Coding Blog

### Week 1

During this first week I have been introduced to the basics of Git, GitHub, GitPods and using the Terminal on my Mac to practice and write code. The challenges have not been numerous or difficult to overcome, yet, but I am positive that I will hit roadblocks and become used to 'blockers' and 'challenges' over the coming weeks and months.
This first week has been a very good introduction to the difficulties that will lie ahead and I am sure that I will become more and more challenged (which is what I'm hoping will happen as I love solving problems/puzzles). I am excited to learn more and grow as a developer but I look forward mostly to learning more languages so I can discover which one or two are the ones that really click with me.  
If you learn anything about me from this blog, it is that I am honest about what I can and cannot do and I have no issues with asking questions or asking for help. However, I don't like to simply be told an answer unless it's very obvious that I am not understanding. I like to learn so I enjoy being *nudged* towards the answer. Also, I may mention my cat more than is necessary **LOL**!
I am excited to start this journey.
