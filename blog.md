# Awesome Inc. Coding Blog

### Week 1

During this first week I have been introduced to the basics of Git, GitHub, GitPods and using the Terminal on my Mac to practice and write code. The challenges have not been numerous or difficult to overcome, yet, but I am positive that I will hit roadblocks and become used to 'blockers' and 'challenges' over the coming weeks and months.
Thus far, my biggest issue has been: being able to remember which resource has which snippit of information I need to remember what my next step is to complete a task. Hopefully soon that information is more easily recalled and I don't have to spend 5 minutes, each time I get slightly lost, searching for the trail (so to speak).
